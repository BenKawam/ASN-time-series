# Inferring the causes of animal social network structure from time-series data
## Structure of the repo
We develop generative models and associated statistical models in Quarto notebooks that are located in the source directory. 
They are the central thread of this repository, and can be read and ran independently from one another.

### Folders
- `empirical_data`: Focal-animal sampling data collected at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary between June 2017 and July 2018.
- `fitted_models`: MCMC samples (obtaining by running the notebooks; not tracked).
- `functions`: functions used in the Quarto notebooks.
- `sim_data`: Syhtnetic data generated in the notebooks (obtaining by running the notebooks; tracked).
- `stan_models`: stan models called in the the notebooks.
